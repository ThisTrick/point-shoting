## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### T076: Keyboard Shortcuts System (NEXT)
**Objective**: Implement global keyboard shortcuts integration

**Tasks**:
1. Wire up useKeyboardShortcuts hook in App.tsx
2. Integrate with ControlPanel for animation controls
3. Add help overlay for shortcut discovery
4. Implement shortcut conflict detection
5. Add user customization support

**Files to modify**:
- `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Add keyboard event listeners
- `src/renderer/components/MainLayout.tsx` - Integrate help overlay
- `src/renderer/components/utils/ShortcutHelp.tsx` - Create help component (NEW)

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

## 📋 UPCOMING TASKS

### T077: Error Boundaries (Priority: High)
**Objective**: Comprehensive error handling across application

**Tasks**:
1. Wrap component tree with ErrorBoundary
2. Implement granular error boundaries for critical sections
3. Add error recovery strategies
4. Integrate with NotificationContext for user feedback
5. Add error logging and reporting

**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

### T078: Performance Monitoring (Priority: Medium)
**Objective**: Optimize application performance

**Tasks**:
1. Integrate usePerformance hook in App.tsx
2. Add FPS monitoring in development mode
3. Implement memory leak detection
4. Add render performance profiling
5. Optimize component re-renders with React.memo

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

## 📦 PHASE 3.8: BUILD & PACKAGING (T082-T085)

### T082: Cross-Platform Builds
- Configure electron-builder for Windows/macOS/Linux
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
- Test on multiple platforms

### T083: Code Signing
- Acquire code signing certificates
- Configure signing for macOS and Windows
- Set up notarization for macOS

### T084: Installer Packages
- Create installers for each platform
- Set up auto-updater
- Test installation and update flows

### T085: Python Engine Integration
- Full integration testing with Python engine from 001- branch
- IPC communication validation
- Performance testing with real animation workloads
- **Main process type refactoring** (includes fixing 40+ type errors)

**Estimated effort for Phase 3.8**: 1-2 days

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT & DEFERRED WORK

### Main Process Type Mismatches (40+ errors)
**Location**: `src/main/`
- MainWindowController.ts
- services/FileManager.ts
- services/PythonEngineBridge.ts
- services/SettingsManager.ts

**Issue**: Using old type structures incompatible with @shared/types

**Solution Path**:
1. Create type compatibility layer
2. Gradually migrate to shared types
3. Update service interfaces
4. Align with renderer type system

**Priority**: Address during T085 (Python Engine Integration)

### Missing Dependencies
- `sharp` module for image processing (optional)
- `@electron-toolkit/utils` for Electron helpers (optional)

**Action**: Review necessity and install if needed for production

## 📝 NOTES

### Development Strategy
- **Renderer-first approach**: UI completion before backend integration
- **Test-driven**: Maintain 100% test pass rate
- **Incremental integration**: Gradual type system migration
- **Deferred optimization**: Main process refactoring moved to Phase 3.8

### Key Decisions
1. **Type System**: Separated @shared/types for IPC communication
2. **JSX Strategy**: Used createElement for generic type safety
3. **Main Process**: Deferred refactoring to avoid blocking renderer work
4. **Testing Priority**: 100% pass rate maintained throughout development

### Lessons Learned
1. JSX and TypeScript generics conflict in .ts files → use .tsx or createElement
2. Fake timers need beforeEach/afterEach setup for reliable tests
3. Pattern matching better than exact strings for format validation
4. Context providers must export context for hook integration

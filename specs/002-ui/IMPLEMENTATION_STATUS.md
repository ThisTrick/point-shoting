## Current Blocking Issue: Type System Alignment

### Problem Description
The main process (services and IPC handlers) was implemented with local type definitions before the @shared/types module was fully established. This creates **303 TypeScript errors** preventing compilation.

### Root Cause
1. **IPC Handlers** (engine-handlers.ts, file-handlers.ts, settings-handlers.ts, window-handlers.ts)
   - Define local interfaces for `AnimationConfig`, `EngineSettings`, `ImageLoadResult`, etc.
   - These conflict with types from `@shared/engine.ts` and `@shared/files.ts`

2. **Services** (PythonEngineBridge.ts, FileManager.ts, SettingsManager.ts, MainWindowController.ts)
   - Import types from `@shared/types` but expect different structures
   - Some types are missing from @shared (added `engine.ts` and `files.ts` but need full refactoring)

3. **Test Files**
   - Mock definitions expect different type shapes
   - E2E and integration tests have ElectronAPI interface mismatches

### Work Completed (Partial Fix)
- ✅ Created `@shared/engine.ts` with 50+ engine/IPC types
- ✅ Created `@shared/files.ts` with 40+ file management types
- ✅ Updated `@shared/index.ts` to export new modules
- ✅ Fixed `EngineStatus` conflict (renamed to `BasicEngineStatus` in core.ts)
- ✅ Added missing properties to `ApplicationState`, `UISettings`
- ✅ Fixed `UITheme` enum (SYSTEM instead of AUTO)
- ✅ Added `ImageLoadResult.processingTime` field

### Work Remaining (To Fix 303 Errors)
1. **Refactor IPC Handlers** (~10 files)
   - Remove all local type definitions
   - Import types from `@shared/types` consistently
   - Ensure parameter types match service method signatures

2. **Align Service Implementations** (~4 files)
   - Update PythonEngineBridge, FileManager, SettingsManager, MainWindowController
   - Use @shared types consistently
   - Fix method signatures to match IPC handler expectations

3. **Update Test Mocks** (~15 files)
   - Contract tests need proper type imports
   - Integration tests need updated ElectronAPI mocks
   - E2E tests need type-safe window.electron definitions

4. **Type Definition Consolidation**
   - Ensure no duplicate type names across modules
   - Add missing types (e.g., some IPC message payloads)
   - Verify all imports resolve correctly

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours for complete type alignment

## Renderer Process - Fully Functional

The **renderer process (React UI) is complete and working** with:
- ✅ All 212 unit tests passing
- ✅ All components properly typed and tested
- ✅ Full internationalization (Ukrainian + English)
- ✅ Complete theme system (light/dark/system)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts with help overlay
- ✅ Comprehensive error boundaries
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Accessibility features

### Renderer Can Be Demonstrated Independently
While the full Electron app cannot build due to main process type errors, the renderer UI can be:
1. Tested via Jest (`npm test` works for renderer tests)
2. Developed in isolation with Vite dev server
3. Demonstrated with mocked IPC calls

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Phase 3.8)
1. **Complete Type Refactoring** (4-6 hours)
   - Systematically update each IPC handler to use @shared/types
   - Remove local type definitions
   - Fix service implementations
   - Update test mocks

2. **Verify Build** (1 hour)
   - Run `npm run build` successfully
   - Verify dist/ output includes main and renderer bundles
   - Test electron app launches

### Phase 3.8 Tasks (After Type Fix)
3. **T082: Cross-Platform Builds** (2 hours)
   - Configure electron-builder for Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Test builds on each platform or in CI

4. **T083: Code Signing** (2 hours)
   - Set up certificates for macOS/Windows
   - Configure electron-builder signing

5. **T084: Installer Packages** (2 hours)
   - Create NSIS installer (Windows)
   - Create DMG (macOS)
   - Create AppImage/deb (Linux)

6. **T085: End-to-End Verification** (3 hours)
   - Test full workflow with Python engine from 001-
   - Verify IPC communication works
   - Validate all features function correctly

## Technical Debt & Recommendations

### Architecture Decisions That Worked Well
1. ✅ **Separation of concerns**: Main/renderer split is clean
2. ✅ **Type system**: @shared/types provides good foundation
3. ✅ **Component structure**: React components are well-organized and tested
4. ✅ **Testing strategy**: 212 passing tests give confidence

### Areas for Improvement
1. ⚠️ **Type Management**: Should have established @shared/types before implementing services
2. ⚠️ **Incremental Refactoring**: Main process refactoring was correctly deferred, but needs priority now
3. ⚠️ **Build Process**: Need stricter TypeScript checking in development to catch issues earlier

### Recommendations for Completion
1. **Focus on type alignment first** - blocking all other work
2. **Use contract tests to validate** - they're already written
3. **Test incrementally** - fix one IPC handler at a time, run tests
4. **Document type patterns** - create clear examples for future development

---

## Conclusion

The Electron UI implementation is **95.3% complete** with a **fully functional renderer process**. The remaining work is primarily **type system alignment** between the main process and the established @shared/types module.

**The renderer can be demonstrated and tested independently**, showing that the UI design and implementation are solid. The type refactoring is mechanical work that will enable the final 4 tasks (Build & Packaging phase) to proceed.

**Recommended Priority**: Complete type refactoring immediately, then proceed with Phase 3.8 tasks in sequence.

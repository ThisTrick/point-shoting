## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a **developer or QA engineer**, I need to verify that all components of the Point-Shoting system (both the Python particle engine and the Electron UI) work correctly together through comprehensive end-to-end testing, so that I can confidently deploy the application knowing that all dependencies are validated and all previous development work functions as intended.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the system has multiple dependency layers (Python packages, Node.js packages, native dependencies), **When** a comprehensive dependency audit is performed, **Then** all dependencies are validated for compatibility, security vulnerabilities are identified, and dependency conflicts are resolved.

2. **Given** the Python engine has multiple service components (particle engine, color mapper, HUD renderer, etc.), **When** end-to-end tests are executed on the engine, **Then** all services interact correctly, data flows through the complete pipeline, and expected outputs are produced.

3. **Given** the UI has React components communicating with the Python backend via IPC, **When** end-to-end UI tests are executed, **Then** all user workflows complete successfully, IPC communication works reliably, and the UI correctly displays engine outputs.

4. **Given** the system has completed features from previous development phases (001-core, 002-ui), **When** regression tests are run, **Then** all previously working functionality continues to work correctly and no regressions are introduced.

5. **Given** test failures occur during the debugging process, **When** developers investigate the failures, **Then** they receive detailed error reports, stack traces, and diagnostic information to identify root causes.

6. **Given** the CI/CD pipeline runs the complete test suite, **When** all tests execute, **Then** the pipeline completes within acceptable time limits and provides comprehensive coverage metrics.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when dependency versions conflict between Python and Node.js ecosystems?
- How does the system handle network failures during E2E tests that require external resources?
- What happens when the Python engine crashes during a UI E2E test?
- How are flaky tests identified and handled during debugging?
- What happens when test execution times exceed acceptable limits?
- How does the system validate cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS)?
- What happens when E2E tests run in headless mode vs. headed mode?
